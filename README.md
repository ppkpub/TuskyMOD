# TuskyMOD

![](/fastlane/metadata/android/en-US/images/icon.png)

TuskyMOD is forked from Tusky which is a beautiful Android client for [Mastodon](https://github.com/tootsuite/mastodon). Mastodon is an ActivityPub federated social network. That means no single entity controls the whole network, rather, like e-mail, volunteers and organisations operate their own independent servers, users from which can all interact with each other seamlessly.
